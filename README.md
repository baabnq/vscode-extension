# Baabnq Language Support

This extension provides support for [The Baabnq Programming Language](https://baabnq.github.io),
including syntax highlighting and execution capabilities.

### Execution
Execution works remotely under https://baabnq.eu.pythonanywhere.com/run, 
which makes this extension require an internet connection to properly function.
